					  <h3>Here's a time line of Tom's life and career:</h3>
					  <ul>
						<li><b>1947</b> - Born in Toledo, Ohio
						</li>
						<li><b>1965</b> - Graduates from Ottawa Hills High School
						<li><b>1969</b> - Starts writing music while attending MIT. Joins the band Freehold, where he meets guitarist Barry Goudreau and drummer Jim Masdea, who later become members of Boston. Receive's bachelor's and...
						</li>
					 </li>
						<li><b>1970</b> - master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering (from MIT) and works for Polaroid Corporation as senior product design engineer. Vocalist Brad Delp is added to the musical collective.
						</li>
						<li><b>1976</b> - Releases his band's first album (self-titled) which becomes the biggest-selling debut album by any artist up to that time
						</li>
					 <li><b>1979</b> - Boston's second album, <em>Don't Look Back</em>, is released under pressure from the record company, but Tom is not satisfied with the result
					 </li>
				   <li><b>1986</b> - Extra time is devoted to <em>Third Stage</em>, the band's third release and is certified 4x Platinum featuring hit song "Amanda"
					 </li>
						<li><b>1987</b> - Sets up the DTS Charitable Foundation in support of animal and children's rights, for which he has raised millions of dollars
				   <li><b>1994</b> - <em>Walk On</em>, Boston's fourth album is released and a few months later is certified Platinum
					 </li>  
				   <li><b>2002</b> - Releases Boston's fifth album, <em>Corporate America</em>. Tom remarks: "The thing that made me decide to break with previous albums and include an overtly political song, was when I discovered that for the first time in American history big business owns the news media...The public has been sold a bill of goods about the free market being a panacea for mankind. Turning corporations loose and letting the profit motive run amok is not a prescription for a more livable world."
					 </li>
					 <li><b>2007</b> - Marries second wife Kim Hart. Two months later, former bandmate Brad Delp takes his own life - a tragic shock.
					 </li>
					 <li><b>2013</b> - Awarded the Compassionate Action Award from PETA. Toward the end of the year, <em>Life, Love & Hope</em> is released, Boston's sixth and latest album
						</li>
					 <li><b>2017</b> - Still touring and rocking as a part of Boston, 40 years later, albeit without any original band members.
						</li>
					  </ul>
